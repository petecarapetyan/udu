# How Everything Here Works

How everything here seems to work.

1. Everything is a typescript file
2. Everything launches with a yargs command
3. Commands are always run as single purpose files from the /src/run directory
4. From that point fanning out - it is pretty much chaos.
5. Some other organizing conventions such as gen and util but documented elsewhere
6. Other stuff to look for, such as - Hey, lotta copying and pasting directories going on here

## Yargs

Yargs is just a tool for organizing CLI launch commands, as used here.

Documentation can be investigated, beginning here:
