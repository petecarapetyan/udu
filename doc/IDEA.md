# What is the basic idea behind udu?

Anything that I do that involves a sequence of setup commands, once I have the basic sequence established ...

- **Repeatable** I want to be able to execute that sequence as many times as I wish
- **Atomic** Ideally they would be relatively atomic, when possible
- **Documented** It would also be nice if they were modestly documented
- **Rabbit Holes** If they followed by basic [option rules](/OPTION_RULES.md) that would remove some nasty rabbit holes
