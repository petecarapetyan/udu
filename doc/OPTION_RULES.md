# Option Rules

To Ininfity and Beyond is a child's toy idea. Infinity sucks. I want a narrowed set of options.

## 2 big, 1 small filter

Big
- DX
- Demand (popularity, jobs, legacy)

Small:
- Measureable Business Value > udu preferences

# Option Narrowing Filters:

Some weighted combination of ...

The filter system works for me because of speed. Infinity quickly turns to mush under a good stack evaluation filter set.

- DX is not for me. Dopamine is a target, not a goal.
- Legacy is best job choice, very limiting.
- Remainder is most likely to be "the standard" in 10 years.
- ubiquity filters
- standards body filters
- large enterprise adoption/sponsorship filters
- tooling filters
- elbow shaped performance filters
- toolable filters
- jobs filters
- jobs delta filters
- Bezos "can't" filters
- success shifting filters
- friend/sponsor/club filters
- market size filters
- measureable data filters
- cost filters
- ownerable/proprietary filters
- researchable optioons filters
- good enough filters (OS2)
- too easy to genericize filters (tomcat)
- security holes filter
- climate change filter
- 

The speed of the above filters is beguiling because it can seem like too much work to consider each filter. 

But then you start running the numbers of NOT looking at that particular filter, and THOSE numbers start pegging infinity within minutes. So it's back to the filters.

# Most Likely Standard 10 Years

- Identify what kills every stack, so far. See above filters.

# Set

Options from this mamoth set:

[here enumerate some 50 or so major initiatives]

# My Chosen Subset

This is personal, pretends to be universal but really is just my feelings about what is universal given my own historical usage of the above filters, and my own interests.
